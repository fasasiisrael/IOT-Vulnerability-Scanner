# IoT Scanner

This is a simple IoT vulnerability scanner built using Python (Flask) for the backend and JavaScript (jQuery) for the frontend.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system
- Flask and required Python packages installed (see `requirements.txt` or check the app.py for new imports, I'm too lazy to update the list) 
- Modern web browser with JavaScript enabled

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/fasasiisrael/IOT-Vulnerability-Scanner.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd IOT-Vulnerability-Scanner
    ```

3. Create a virtual environment (recommended) and activate it:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
    ```

4. Install required Python packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Start the Flask application:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`.

3. Enter the IP address of the IoT device you want to scan into the input field and click the "Scan" button.

4. The application will perform an Nmap scan and display the results (OS information, open ports) along with any identified vulnerabilities.

## Directory Structure

- `app.py`: Main Flask application file.
- `scanner/`: Directory containing Python modules for scanning and vulnerability checks.
  - `nmap_scanner.py`: Module for Nmap scanning functions.
  - `vulnerability_scanner.py`: Module for vulnerability scanning functions.
  - `utils.py`: Utility functions for IoT scanning.
- `static/`: Static files (CSS, JavaScript, images).
  - `style.css`: CSS file for styling.
  - `scripts.js`: Client-side JavaScript for AJAX and DOM manipulation.
- `templates/`: HTML templates.
  - `index.html`: Main frontend template for the application.
  - `results.html`: Template for displaying scan results.

## Notes

- Ensure that Nmap is installed and available in your system's PATH environment variable for the scanning functionality to work properly.
- Customize the frontend (`index.html`) and styling (`style.css`) to fit your project's design requirements.
- This application is intended for educational purposes and should be used responsibly and legally.
